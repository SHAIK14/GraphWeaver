# Manufacturing Production Schedule - Q1 2026

## Assembly Line A - Electric Motors
- **Lead**: Sarah Chen
- **Capacity**: 500 units/week
- **Dependencies**: Requires circuit boards from TechParts Inc, motors from FastAssembly Co
- **Current Status**: Running at 85% capacity
- **Quality Issues**: 3% defect rate on bearings from Precision Tools

## Assembly Line B - Control Systems
- **Lead**: Marcus Rodriguez
- **Capacity**: 300 units/week
- **Dependencies**: Sensors (TechParts Inc), aluminum housings (Apex Materials)
- **Current Status**: 95% capacity - bottleneck on sensor supply
- **Notes**: Considering dual-sourcing sensors to reduce dependency

## Inventory Targets
- **Critical Components**: Maintain 2-week buffer for all sub-15 day lead times
- **Long Lead Items**: Motors (21 days) - maintain 4-week buffer
- **JIT Items**: Packaging, fasteners - 1 week max

## Supplier Performance
- **Apex Materials**: 98% on-time delivery, high quality
- **TechParts Inc**: 92% on-time, occasional quality issues with sensors
- **FastAssembly Co**: 85% on-time - long lead times causing delays
- **Precision Tools**: 99% on-time, reliable partner
- **EcoSupply Ltd**: New vendor, monitoring performance (30-day lead time concern)

## Risk Factors
1. Single-source dependency on FastAssembly Co for motors
2. TechParts sensor quality trending downward
3. EcoSupply long lead times may impact sustainability goals
