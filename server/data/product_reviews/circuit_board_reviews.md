**Review:** Disappointed with recent shipment. Found 3 defective boards out of 500. The soldering points were weak and caused failures in our assembly line. Had to halt production for 2 hours. Quality control needs improvement.

**Review:** Mixed experience. The boards work fine but documentation was lacking. We had compatibility issues with our power supply units initially. Support team helped resolve but took longer than expected.

**Review:** Serious quality issues! Multiple boards failed thermal testing. The heat dissipation is not as specified. This caused component damage in our products. Requesting full refund and investigating supplier change.
