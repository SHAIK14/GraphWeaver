**Review:** Outstanding structural integrity. These frames exceed our load requirements. The welding quality is top-notch and the corrosion resistance is excellent. Our go-to supplier for all steel components.

**Review:** Frames are solid but delivery was delayed by 2 weeks. This caused scheduling issues for our assembly team. The product quality is good when it arrives, but reliability of delivery needs work.

**Review:** Found rust spots on several frames from the last shipment. The protective coating was inconsistent. Had to reject 15% of the order. This is a safety concern for structural components.

**Review:** Generally good quality frames. Pricing is competitive. One suggestion: better packaging would prevent the minor scratches we sometimes see on arrival. Not a major issue but room for improvement.

**Review:** Disaster! The dimensions were off by 3mm on an entire batch. None of the frames fit our assembly jigs. Complete production stop for a day. This cost us significant money and customer delays.
