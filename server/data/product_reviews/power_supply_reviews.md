**Review:** Reliable power supply units. Voltage regulation is within spec and efficiency is good. The only concern is the fan noise at high loads, but acceptable for industrial use.

**Review:** These PSUs have been rock solid for our assembly line. Zero failures in 6 months of heavy use. The overvoltage protection has saved us from several potential issues. Excellent product!

**Review:** Had two units fail within the first month. Both showed signs of overheating. The thermal design seems inadequate for continuous operation. Warranty replacement was slow - took 3 weeks.

**Review:** Decent PSU but the connector types are non-standard. Required custom adapters for our setup. Would appreciate better compatibility with industry-standard connectors. Performance is otherwise acceptable.

**Review:** Critical failure! A power supply caught fire during testing. Fortunately no injuries but this is unacceptable. Investigating root cause - appears to be a capacitor defect. All units from this batch are quarantined.
